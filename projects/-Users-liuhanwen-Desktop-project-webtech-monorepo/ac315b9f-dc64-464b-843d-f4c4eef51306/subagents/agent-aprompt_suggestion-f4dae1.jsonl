User ran /code-review and I provided a code review report\n2. User ran /learn and I asked if they wanted to save a skill, they said no\n3. User ran /eval and I showed there are no eval definitions\n4. User ran /checkpoint and I showed the current checkpoint status\n5. User got an error message about an unknown skill \"hookify\"\n6. User asked about \"fork 是幹嘛的\" (what is fork)\n7. I explained Git fork\n8. User clarified they meant the Claude Code /fork command\n9. I explained the /fork command in Claude Code\n\nThe user was exploring Claude Code features and just learned about /fork. They were in the middle of a code review workflow. Their uncommitted changes are still there.\n\nWhat would they naturally do next? Looking at the flow:\n- They completed a code review ✓\n- They skipped learning patterns ✓\n- They checked eval (none) ✓\n- They checked checkpoint (none) ✓\n- They explored what /fork does ✓\n\nAfter learning about /fork and understanding their conversation context, they might:\n1. Go back to their actual work - commit the reviewed changes\n2. Create a checkpoint since they just checked and there were none\n3. Just continue exploring\n\nGiven they just finished a code review that passed and have uncommitted changes, the natural next step would be to commit. But they were also exploring checkpoints, so they might want to create one.\n\nActually, looking at the flow, they seem to be exploring Claude Code features. After understanding /fork, they might want to go back to their original conversation or continue with their work.\n\nLet me think about what they would naturally type next... They might want to:\n- commit the changes since code review passed\n- or continue exploring\n\nI think the most natural next step after a successful code review would be to commit. Let me suggest that.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":9,"cache_creation_input_tokens":789,"cache_read_input_tokens":83964,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":789},"output_tokens":3,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXbtiqfGh4u3yef2wkYd3","type":"assistant","uuid":"cf21e76d-5ddf-423a-b96f-16ec78da5aea","timestamp":"2026-01-29T15:18:23.729Z"}
